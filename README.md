# WebDevelopment-course

This repository contains my code and notes from the [The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far

I’ve completed all modules up to the **React** section. This includes:

- HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox, Grid
- JavaScript (ES6), DOM Manipulation
- Node.js, Express.js
- EJS Templating
- APIs and Server-Side Integration
- Git & GitHub Basics
- Postgrees and Mongoose
- Authentication and Security
- React.js Fundamentals

## 📌 Current Status

At this point in the course, I’m pausing my studies to focus on developing real-world freelance projects. The goal is to build a strong portfolio solving real problems with custom web apps.

## 🛠️ How This Repo Can Help You

You can explore completed exercises and mini-projects organized by topic/module. It's a great reference if you're also taking the course or learning full-stack web development.

## 🚀 What's Next

I plan to return to the advanced modules later, but for now, I’ll be applying the skills learned here to build complete web applications and client solutions.
